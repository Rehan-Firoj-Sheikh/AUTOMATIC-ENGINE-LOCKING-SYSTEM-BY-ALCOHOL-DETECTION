# AUTOMATIC ENGINE LOCKING SYSTEM BY ALCOHOL DETECTION
 Automatic engine locking system was devised to prevent drivers from driving vehicles in a boozed up state and helping in the cause to promote “not to drink and drive”

 INTRODUCTION:- 
 
 Road safety has always been a major
talking point for the society. There are various signs, lanes
and rules that have been implemented by governments
across the globe to prevent accidents and fatalities. But
there is a major population that still do not follow these
rules are because of that we hear about a lot of cases of
road accidents, lane violations, and drunken driving
fatalities and injuries. So if the driver even attempt’s to drive
the vehicle in a bevvy state, they will not be able to do so.
Therefore, this project has been designed in such a way that
it pushes public safety first especially road safety. More
over with the help of this project the authors aim is to reach
the masses and display to them importance of road safety
and create awareness amongst them.

WORKING :-

Switch on the power button due to which the motor (Engine) will start to rotate.
Set the potentiometer (Sensitivity) of the alcohol sensor and take the sample of
alcohol and move towards the alcohol sensor.
The alcohol sensor gives the high voltage output i.e. 1, so the gate terminal of the
MOSFET receive the high input voltage signal, so that it provides the high resistive
path (negligible current) to the flow of the current so that the motor (Engine) will turn
off automatically and the buzzer make sound of beep.
 Similarly, vice versa if alcohol not available near the system then the alcohol sensor
will gives the low voltage output i.e. 0, so that the gate terminal of the MOSFET
receive the low input voltage signal, so that it provides the low resistive path
(negligible resistance) to the flow of current so that the motor (Engine) will rotate
continuously and the buzzer will not create the sound like beep till the system
wouldn’t sense the alcohol.

CONCLUSION :-

In this project, we have tried to tackle the serious problem of drunken driving by developing
and designing an efficient system. Our main motive is to ultimately urge people to create
awareness amongst themselves and prevent them from drink and driving. If this project can be
implemented on a large scale then surely a lot of precious lives can be saved and it will also urge
the public to stop people from drink and drive.
